# pands-project

## Approach
My research on the iris dataset showed its main use is in machine learning. It is a famous dataset generated in the 1930s and used in countless papers, initially in for classification algorithms and more recently for machine learning. As such, it is available from a wide variety of sources. The most straightforward are Comma Separated Variable files but for this project I elected to import the dataset as a pandas dataframe. This will allow me to use a broad spectrum of data analysis tools available through pandas to analyse and report on the data.

Initially, I intend to use pandas functions to generate summary statistics that describe the dataset. Then I will use pyplot to visualise those statistics. When the visualisations are complete that will give me an indication of what attributes will help to classify a particular instance. I then will define a function that takes in dimensions from the user for the four attributes, and insofar as possible, classify the user's data as a particular variety.
